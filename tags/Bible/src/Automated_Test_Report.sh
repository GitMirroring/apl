# Automated_Test_Report.sh -- narrow down a testcase failure to a minimal
# reproducing set, and package the findings into a tarball ready to email.
#
# When a testcase fails only in the context of other testcases that ran
# before it (shared-workspace interference, not a bug in the failing file
# itself), this script finds a minimal ordered subset of the earlier
# testcases that still reproduces the same failure -- so the interference
# can be root-caused without re-running the whole suite by hand. Its own
# narration is written to culprits.log next to summary.log, and its
# findings (culprits.log plus the failing testcase's own .tc.log) are
# archived into culprits.tar.gz for emailing to bug-apl@gnu.org.
#
# Usage: (from the src/ directory; './apl' must already be built)
#   ./Automated_Test_Report.sh [--svn-bisect] [logdir] [selection]
#
# --svn-bisect, if given (anywhere on the command line), additionally
# searches backward through SVN history (see Step "bisect SVN history"
# below) for the last revision that did NOT have the fault, once a
# minimal reproducer has been found and verified. This does a full
# 'svn export' + 'autoreconf' + './configure' + 'make' for every
# revision it tests -- off by default, since it can take a long time;
# on by request, since collecting this information was explicitly said
# to not be time critical.
#
# logdir defaults to "testcases" and must contain the .tc files to run --
# e.g. "testcases" (-> 'make test's set) or "testcases_3" (-> 'make test3's
# set). This script runs every *.tc file in logdir itself (see Step 1) to
# produce a fresh summary.log there; it does NOT read/trust one left behind
# by an earlier, separate 'make test'/'make test3' invocation, since that
# could be stale relative to the current build, sources, or SVN revision.
#
# selection is only used when summary.log has more than one failing
# testcase (see step 2b below): a 1-based number picking which one to
# isolate, in the numbered list this script would otherwise prompt for
# interactively -- pass it to run non-interactively (e.g. from a cron job
# or CI) instead of being asked.
#
# Algorithm (see plan.txt):
#   1. Run every .tc file in logdir fresh, to produce an up-to-date
#      summary.log.
#   2. Parse it for the ordered list of testcases that were run, each
#      one's error count, and every one with a nonzero error count -- this
#      list is kept as an in-memory array throughout, never re-derived
#      from a shell wildcard (globs get re-sorted by the shell, which is
#      exactly the ordering trap this script exists to avoid).
#   2b. If more than one testcase failed, show them as a numbered list and
#      ask which one to isolate (or take it from the command line) --
#      a single run's summary.log cannot say by itself which of several
#      failures is an independent bug and which are follow-on damage from
#      an earlier one. With only one failure, nothing to choose.
#   3. Drop every testcase that ran after the chosen failure -- irrelevant.
#   3b. First reduction pass: if any OTHER testcase that ran before the
#      chosen one also failed, try dropping all of them at once first, to
#      directly answer the question Step 2b's dialog raises (independent
#      bug, or follow-on effect of another already-known failure?) before
#      the general-purpose minimization below has to work it out the hard
#      way.
#   4. Re-run apl once to confirm the resulting set still reproduces the
#      same failure (the log may be stale).
#   5. Bisect: repeatedly try halving the remaining candidate set.
#   6. Remove candidates one at a time until every remaining one is
#      individually required to reproduce the same failure.
#   7. Build and verify a standalone .apl reproducer from the minimal set.
#   8. (--svn-bisect only) Search backward through SVN history for the
#      last revision without the fault, using a dual-slope search: double
#      the step backward until a passing revision is found, then halve the
#      step, walking forward, until the good/bad boundary is pinned down
#      exactly. Every revision tested gets its own build (see Step
#      "bisect SVN history" for why one revision at a time, reusing a
#      single scratch directory that is wiped before each one, was chosen
#      over the faster alternatives).
#
# Every step below is narrated as Step / Action / Boundary Condition /
# Consequence -- see plan.txt for the intent: a reader of culprits.log
# should be able to reconstruct what was done, why, what the result of
# each action was, and what was concluded from it, without having
# watched the run live.

# If it is still running after that, this is treated as a genuine HANG,
# not a slow-but-progressing run -- and specifically NOT handled by
# sending it ^C/SIGINT or any other signal. Bill Heagy's own ⎕PLOT reports
# are the exact reason why: GNU APL's sem_wait_safe() EINTR-retry logic
# has already shown that a signal arriving while a wait is blocked can
# change behavior in confusing, hard-to-reproduce ways, on top of
# whatever caused the hang in the first place -- introducing a NEW signal
# here, purely to end an automated diagnostic run, would risk manufacturing
# a second, unrelated issue on top of the one actually being investigated.
#
# Instead: gdb attaches to the still-RUNNING process via -p (ptrace-based,
# not a signal) and takes two full-thread backtrace samples a few seconds
# apart -- two, not one, so a reader can tell a genuinely STUCK wait/loop
# (same location both times) from a merely slow, still-progressing
# computation (a different location the second time) -- before the
# process is terminated with SIGKILL, the one signal that cannot be
# caught, blocked, or ignored, so ending the hung run this way can never
# itself run any of the target's own (possibly buggy) signal-handling
# code. The backtrace(s) are written to LOGFILE.hang_gdb.txt.
#
# 'gdb -p PID' attaching to an unrelated (non-child) process is blocked
# outright on a stock Ubuntu/Debian system by the Yama LSM's default
# ptrace_scope=1 -- confirmed empirically ("Could not attach to process")
# -- so this relies on apl's own main() calling
# prctl(PR_SET_PTRACER, PR_SET_PTRACER_ANY, ...) at startup (main.cc) to
# allow it; an apl built without that call will simply produce no
# backtrace here (gdb's own attach failure is not treated as fatal by
# this function, see below), same as when gdb itself is not installed.
# A two-sample design driven by keeping ONE gdb session alive across a
# 'continue' and re-interrupting it externally was tried first and found
# unreliable (a second external SIGINT sent to gdb sporadically lands in
# its own embedded Python I/O layer instead of stopping the inferior,
# confirmed by direct testing) -- two independent, short-lived attach/
# detach cycles, as used here, have no such race and are what "most
# stable, not fastest" actually means in this specific case.

# 8. (--svn-bisect only) search SVN history for the last revision without
# the fault, using $APL_FILE (Step 7's verified standalone reproducer) as
# the fixed yardstick against which every tested revision's own freshly
# built apl is checked -- no need to re-run the minimal .tc set itself
# per revision.
#
# Design choices, and why (per explicit user direction: prioritize
# stability over speed here, since repeated SVN operations + full rebuilds
# are exactly the kind of thing that can go wrong in ways that are hard to
# notice half-way through a long unattended run):
#   - ONE scratch directory, reused for every revision tested (wiped with
#     rm -rf and rebuilt from scratch each time), never several at once --
#     keeps disk/memory usage flat regardless of how many revisions end up
#     being tested, important on small machines.
#   - A full 'svn export' (not 'svn switch'/'svn up' inside a single
#     persistent checkout) for every revision -- more network/disk traffic
#     than an incremental update, but leaves zero generated state (old
#     .deps/*.Po files, a stale configure script, ...) behind from the
#     previous revision to possibly interact badly with the new one; this
#     is the exact same class of problem diagnosed independently for
#     David Alden's SVN r2071 build failure (a stale .deps/apl-Archive.Po
#     left over from an earlier build in the same directory) -- avoided
#     here by construction rather than by hoping 'make clean' catches
#     everything.
#   - 'autoreconf -fi' before './configure' every time, since 'configure'
#      itself is generated and NOT under SVN control (confirmed via
#      'svn status configure' showing '?') -- a plain export has no
#      configure script to run at all.
#   - the exact './configure' arguments used for the CURRENT build are
#     replayed via 'config.status --config', so every tested revision is
#     built the same way the live tree was.
#   - a dual-slope search: double the backward step until a passing
#     revision is found (no known-good revision is assumed to exist),
#     then halve the step, walking forward from that known-good point,
#     until the good/bad boundary is pinned down exactly. This finds the
#     boundary in a small number of full rebuilds without needing a
#     pre-supplied lower bound.
#   - any SVN or build failure at a given revision is treated as
#     inconclusive (narrated, artifacts kept for inspection) rather than
#     aborting the whole search -- one flaky revision should not throw
#     away everything already found.

# 10. package diagnostic artifacts into a tarball the user can email us.
#
# tar can append to an existing (uncompressed) archive but not to an
# already-gzipped one, so the archive is built up file by file with
# plain 'tar -rf' (or '-cf' for the first file) and only gzipped once,
# as the very last step -- more artifacts can be added the same way
# later without needing to touch the compression step at all.
#
# culprits_<machine>.tar.gz (FINAL_TARBALL) is the user-facing artifact
# from a previous run and must never be deleted or left in a half-written
# state -- so the new archive is built entirely under a .new name
# (TARFILE) and only the finished .tar.new.gz is renamed onto it,
# atomically, once compression has actually succeeded. The machine tag in
# the name (see MACHINE_TAG above) means reports from several different
# machines can be collected side by side -- and attached to the same
# email -- without one overwriting another.
