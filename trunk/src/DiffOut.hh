/// FileBuffers.hh for why: this class never calls filebuf::open(), so a
/// filebuf's own inherited FILE* member would stay permanently NULL, and
/// libc++'s basic_filebuf::xsputn() has its own FILE*-based bulk-write
/// fast path that bypasses our overridden overflow() and segfaults on
/// exactly that NULL FILE* for any multi-character write. Confirmed to
/// affect ErrOut_filebuf/CinOut_filebuf on macOS 27/libc++ (Paul Rockwell,
/// bug-apl@gnu.org, 2026-09); DiffOut backs COUT/UERR and shares the
/// identical latent flaw even though no report has hit it here (COUT's
/// own real output apparently never went through a bulk multi-character
/// write early enough to trigger it) -- converted proactively rather than
/// waiting for a second report.
