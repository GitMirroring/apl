/**
   Reusable argument-validation building blocks for primitive eval_XXX()
   functions.

   Many primitives share the same handful of argument-shape invariants
   (e.g. "A is a scalar or vector", "A and B are conformable"). Rather than
   hand-writing the check plus its )MORE text at every call site, each
   function here does both: if the invariant does not hold, it sets )MORE
   text (following the convention in the ")MORE error convention" project:
   RANK_ERROR shows ranks, LENGTH_ERROR shows shapes, DOMAIN_ERROR shows
   the offending value) and throws the matching APL error. If a call
   returns normally, the invariant holds and the caller may rely on it
   without re-checking.

   \b where is the arity-prefix for the primitive, e.g. "A⍴B" -- see the
   MORE_ERROR() convention (project_apl_more_error_convention memory).
   \b argname is the argument's own name as used in \b where, e.g. "A".
