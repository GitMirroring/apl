/** Handling of crash signals (SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, and SIGABRT).

    When the interpreter crashes, then:

    1. a backtrace is printed (with async-signal-safe functions only),

    2. a crash-dump tar file with the backtrace, the )SIS of the crash, the
       shapes, ranks, and depths of the values involved, and information
       about the interpreter and the system is written to
       ~/.config/gnu-apl/last_crash.tar (if that directory exists) or else
       to /tmp/gnu-apl-<uid>-last_crash.tar (the two previous reports are
       kept as last_crash.1.tar and last_crash.2.tar), and the user is
       asked to send it to bug-apl@gnu.org, and

    3. the interpreter continues in immediate execution with a cleared SI
       (via siglongjmp() to main()'s recovery point).

    Step 3 is skipped (and the interpreter exits as before) when running
    testcase files (-T), with --TM 4 (exit on error), for a crash in a
    thread other than the main thread, before main() has set its recovery
    point, and for a crash while handling a crash. Step 2 is skipped when
    running testcase files: IO_Files::report_abnormal_exit() reports the
    crash there.
